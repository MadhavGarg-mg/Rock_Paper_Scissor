# Rock_Paper_Scissor

This is a rock_paper_scissor game where you choose input from rock, paper, and scissor then the
computer chooses a random input from a list of rock, paper, and scissor. According to the rule of
rock paper scissors if the player wins, draws, or loses the counter goes up and a message is sent
accordingly after which the player can choose to play again. If the player plays again the same
cycle continues but if the player decides to stop playing then the final message is displayed that
shows how many games they won, drew, or lost.

You can install the program directly but you will need to install the module 'random' for the code
to work properly.
